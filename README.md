# Financial-Analysis
 Financial Analysis for a Southern Water Corp which is an Israeli water desalination company. This Financial Analysis includes Revenues, Expenses and EBIT Analysis.

## Context
Southern Water Corp. is an Israeli water desalination company that sells freshwater for three customer segments: Residential, Public, and Private. Since the demand for agricultural and residential use is rising, Southern Water Corp. needed to maximize the availability of its three desalination plants. This has resulted in increased revenue for the calendar year. While the increase in revenue is fantastic, Southern Water Corp does not want an unsustainable rise in costs.

Costs between the various plants vary due to the type of desalinated water they produce. Residential use requires only soft water, which contains no minerals. Public and Private consumers need a mix of soft water and hard water, which contains minerals like calcium. As such, the Operational Expenses between these three plants will vary according to the production potential of desalinated water and chemical costs associated with water type. With this context in mind, management wants to understand the other side of the cost equation. With increased revenues, has Southern Water Corp seen production costs increase significantly?

This is where you come in! With the knowledge and foundation you’ve established across the Excel and Finance Units– you can dive deep into the Financial Data and provide management with a story that captures how the company is performing from an EBIT, Revenues, and Operational Expenses Perspective.

## Read Me Before Starting
Southern Water Corp sells two types of water product; Hard and Soft Water which is retailed to Residential, Public and Private Customers. 
These sales (Revenues) are stored in centres known as PROFIT CENTRES. 

Similarly you can imagine that production of these water products incurs costs. These costs are then stored and allocated to COST CENTRES.

Cost Centres - There are centres which handle all cost generating activities. 
If a business has set costs, they will normally flow through to a cost centre for capture. 
In most cases, ONLY costs flow through Cost Centres, but depending on company set up - you may have the rare instance where there are revenue-generating activities included in Cost Centres. 
For Southern Water Corp, we've simplified this structure so revenues stay in Profit Centres and Costs stay in Cost Centres.

| Acoount Type | This column provides information on whether the dataset is referencing Financial Actuals, Financial Budgets, Water Production Actuals or Water Production Budget. |
| Value Drivers | This Column let's you know whether the Value Driver belongs to Revenue or Expenses so you are aware of which cost centres / profit centres you need to pay attention towards. |
| Unit | These are Kootha, Surjek or Jutik. The Unit column indicates, for that row of data, which Unit it applies towards. |
| Month | This represents the month that data was calculated for. |
| Centre Type | Costs / Profits either fall into a Cost Centre or Profit Centre. This column provides the individual with an understanding as to whether the cost centre is a Cost Centre or a Profit Centre. |
| Cost Centre / Profit Centre | Based off the Centre Type, this lets the individual know whether the 'Centre' is a Cost Centre or Profit Centre. E.g. Revenue Sales 003 - By itself we don't know if it is a cost centre or profit centre. However, when this is paired with the Centre Type - we know for sure that this is a Profit Centre. |
| Cost Centre / Profit Centre Elements | A Cost Centre/Profit Centre is made up of 'elements' which tie into the Cost Centre.  |
| Row Data | This is the unique value that is stored for every row entry. |
